* Wisen data model based on RDF

Decision: The data model of the wisen application shall be based on the Resource Description Framework.

Drivers:
- The data that moves through the app doesn't conform to closed
  schemata, therefore an open data model is needed.
- The data potentially originates at many different locations on the
  web. With the semantic web and RDF there is already a solution to
  this problem of federated data.
- We want to use LLMs to translate natural language into formal
  descriptions. We conjecture that LLMs perform better with these
  translations if the target schema is widely known.
