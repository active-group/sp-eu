* No blank nodes

RDF allows for blank nodes, i.e. nodes without a global
identifier. These blank nodes are problematic in many use cases,
especially for updates. E.g. if have a blank node with a property
"latitude: 48", and the user wants to change this to "latitude: 49",
we have no way of knowing whether the user wants to create a new blank
node with the updates property or she wants to update the existing
property.

Ramifications:
- The frontend has to generate IDs. We use UUIDs for that.
- The backend may want to skolemize on ingress.
