* Development

The project has a flake.nix, so you can enter the development environment with:

#+begin_src
nix develop
#+end_src

Common commands (to be used from within the [[./wisen][wisen]] subdirectory):

- Run backend server: =clj -M:backend=
- Run backend server with repl: =clj -M:backend -r PORT=
- Run backend tests: =clj -T:build test-clj=
- Run frontend watch: =clj -T:build cljs-watch=

The frontend then runs on [[http://localhost:4321]]. The cljs test display is at
[[http://localhost:9501/]].

Ollama + Keycloak backing services can be started in a local QEMU VM via

#+begin_src shell
nix run .#dev-vm
#+end_src

Note that on macOS only this requires a properly configured and booted
=linux-builder= (=nix run nixpkgs#darwin.linux-builder=). Follow the [[https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#sec-darwin-builder][instructions in
the manual]] on how to configure your macOS system to automatically dispatch
=aarch64-linux= builds to the =linux-builder=.

** Java dependencies

After you updated dependencies in `deps.edn` you have to update the corresponding lockfile as well:

#+begin_src shell
nix run .#update-clj-lockfile
#+end_src

* Deployment

The live system is hosted at [[https://sp-eu.active-group.de]]. Deployment
happens continually via CI pipeline.

** Secret management

We use [[https://github.com/ryantm/agenix][agenix]] to manage secrets (mainly the DB password used by the Keycloak
service). See [[./nix/secrets][this directory]].
