* Development

Common commands (to be used from within the [[./wisen][wisen]] subdirectory):

- Run backend server: =clj -M:backend=
- Run backend tests: =clj -T:build test-clj=
- Run backend repl: =clj -M:nrepl:backend -m nrepl.cmdline=
- Run frontend watch: =clj -M:shadow-cljs:frontend watch :frontend :test=

The frontend then runs on http://localhost:4321. The cljs test display is at
http://localhost:9501/.

Ollama + Keycloak backing services can be started in a local QEMU VM via

```shell
nix run .#dev-vm
```

Note that on macOS only this requires a properly configured and booted
=linux-builder= (=nix run nixpkgs#darwin.linux-builder=). Follow the [[https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#sec-darwin-builder][instructions in
the manual]] on how to configure your macOS system to automatically dispatch
=aarch64-linux= builds to the =linux-builder=.

* Deployment

The live system is hosted at https://sp-eu.ci.active-group.de. Deployment
happens continually via CI pipeline.

** Secret management

We use [[https://github.com/ryantm/agenix][agenix]] to manage secrets (mainly the DB password used by the Keycloak
service). See [[./nix/secrets][this directory]].
